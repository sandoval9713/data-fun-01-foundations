> Professional Python project: inspect data and plan experiments.

## Our Approach: Learn by Doing

This course builds capabilities through working projects.
**Durable skills** are grounded in real work:
setting up a professional environment,
reading and running code,
understanding the logic,
and pushing work to a shared repository.
Each example is a professional Python project.

## First, Make Sure Your Machine is Set Up

Complete **Workflow A: Set Up Your Machine** in
[pro-analytics-02](https://denisecase.github.io/pro-analytics-02/).

## Project Motivation

Analysts often begin by opening tabular data in a tool such as Excel
and looking through the rows and columns.

Python is another popular way to work with data.
Python lets us write instructions once and run as needed.
Both Excel and Python let us inspect data, describe it, and start
thinking about what we might do with it.

## Explore and Annotate a Dataset

This project introduces Python through a common data analytics task:

- Explore the Palmer Penguins dataset first in Excel.
- Then use Python to load, inspect, and describe the data.

## Project Concepts

The project introduces several important ideas:

1. **Grain** - what one row of data represents.
2. **Columns** - the information available about each observation.
3. **Target** - something we might want to predict later.
4. **Feature** - information that might help predict the target.
5. **Rationale** - why we think a feature might be useful.

Python functions enable writing reusable instructions and
then calling the functions with different information.

## Custom Narrative (Extracted from Output)

```text
--------------------------------------------------------
Analyst Data Description (and Possible Prediction Plan):
--------------------------------------------------------
    A row represents:           one penguin
    A target we might predict:  body_mass_g
    A feature that might help:  bill_length_mm
    Why the feature might help:
A bigger penguin probably has both a longer bill and more mass,
so bill length might help predict body mass.
That is, a longer bill may indicate a larger body mass.
```

## Initial Results

## Important Folders and Files

- **data/** - the CSV data file
- **docs/** - the project narrative and documentation
- **src/datafun/app.py** - the Python logic
- **zensical.toml** - documentation site config

## Get this Example Project

Follow the
[step-by-step workflow guide](https://denisecase.github.io/pro-analytics-02/workflow-b-apply-example-project/)
carefully.

Why? Because getting a Python project running your
machine requires many parts working together -
and once it runs, it makes everything else possible.

## Challenges

Challenges are expected.
Sometimes instructions may not quite match your operating system.
When issues occur, share screenshots, error messages,
and details about what you tried.
Working through issues is part of implementing professional projects.

## Success

After completing Phase 1. **Start & Run**, you'll have this example project
running on your machine.
A new file `project.log` will appear in the root project folder
and running the example script will print out:

```shell
===================================
END main() - Executed successfully!
===================================
```

## Command Reference

The commands below are used in the workflow guide above.
They are provided here for convenience.

Follow the guide for the **full instructions**.

<details markdown>
<summary>Show command reference</summary>

### In a machine terminal (open in your `Repos` folder)

Open a machine terminal in your `Repos` folder,
change directory (cd) into the new folder,
and run `code .` to open only this project in VS Code:

```shell
git clone https://github.com/sandoval9713/datafun-01-foundations

cd datafun-01-foundations
code .
```

When VS Code opens, accept the Extension Recommendations
(click **`Install All`** or similar when asked).

### In a VS Code terminal

To set up a local project Python environment (managed by `uv`)
and align VS Code with it, run the following commands.

These are listed for convenience.
For best results, follow the detailed instructions in
[pro-analytics-02 guide](https://denisecase.github.io/pro-analytics-02/).

Use VS Code menu option `Terminal` / `New Terminal` to open a **VS Code terminal**
in the root project folder.
Copy each command, paste into your terminal, and hit ENTER,
to run each command one at a time.

```shell
uv self update
uv python pin 3.14

uv python install
uv lock --upgrade
uv sync
```

If asked: "We noticed a new environment has been created.
Do you want to select it for the workspace folder?" Click **"Yes"**.
If successful, you'll see a new `.venv` folder appear in the root project folder.

Install and run pre-commit checks (twice if necessary as shown below):

```shell
uv run pre-commit install
uv run pre-commit autoupdate

git add -A
uv run pre-commit run --all-files
# repeat if changes were made by pre-commit tasks
uv run pre-commit run --all-files
```

### Daily Workflow (Working With Python Project Code)

VS Code should have only this project open.
Open a VS Code terminal (menu: `Terminal` / `New Terminal`) and run:

```shell
git pull

# run the module
uv run python -m datafun.app

# do chores
uv run ruff format .
uv run ruff check . --fix
uv run ty check
uv run python -m pytest
uv run python -m zensical build
```

While editing project code and docs, repeat the commands above to
run files, check them, and rebuild docs as needed.

Save progress frequently.
Some tools may make changes;
you may need to **re-run git `add` and `commit`**
to ensure everything gets committed before pushing.

```shell
git add -A
git commit -m "your message here"
# repeat if changes were made (try the UP ARROW)
git add -A
git commit -m "your message here"

git push -u origin main
```

</details>

## Helpful Tips

- Use the **UP ARROW** and **DOWN ARROW** in the terminal
  to scroll through past commands.
- Use `CTRL+f` to find (and replace) text within a file.

## Much Can Be Ignored

- You do not need to add to or modify `tests/`.
  Tests are recommended and provided for example only.
- Many files are silent helpers.
  [Explore](https://denisecase.github.io/professional-python-project-explainer/)
  as you like, but most files are never touched.
- You do NOT need to understand everything;
  let understanding build over time.

## As Needed

If VS Code does not automatically use the new `.venv` environment:

1. Open the Command Palette (`Ctrl+Shift+P`).
2. Run **Python: Select Interpreter**.
3. Select the interpreter from this project's `.venv` folder.

If VS Code still does not recognize the environment or newly installed tools:

1. Open the Command Palette (`Ctrl+Shift+P`).
2. Run **Developer: Reload Window**.

## Troubleshooting >>>

If you see something like this in your terminal: `>>>` or `...`
You accidentally started Python interactive mode.
It happens.
Press `Ctrl c` (both keys together) or `Ctrl+Z` then `Enter` on Windows.
